# Kickstarts

At one time I relied heavily on RedHat Kickstart to automate installation of machines, this is probably more needed today with DevOps being a "thing". I've been doing the DevOps pattern since way before it was a pattern. I used CVS for revision control of config files and various scripting languages for system automation. Kickstart is part of that.

Feel free to use these script as you see fit.
